### Sourcetree
Sourcetree has a graphics user interface.
You can do what you want without those commands, just by clickong the buttoms.

## Basic Markdown
For Writting the contribution and update log.
Markdown canbe covered very quick.

## Cocos Startup
Read the source code!

### Basic Structure
It uses classes to do all the stuff. You can make a module a class and call it in other classes.

At last, you gonna initialize and call one single class in the `main()` function.

### Things about collaboration
So basically our duties are to write all the classes to complete the game.
But the problem here is, how to determine the order and division of each.

## Game Function Partitioning
Is open for debate.
